.SYNOPSIS
  Restarts the File Conversion Service (OCRex.Convert).
    
.DESCRIPTION
  The File Conversion Service needs to be restarted due to a memory leak bug. This script was created
  to enable business teams to restart the service.
  
  
  Users in the Active Directory group 'Dev-Restart-Service-FileConversion' will be able to restart the service.
  
  NOTE:
  
    The following configuration must be performed on the server for this to work from a remote machine.
    
    1. Enable Firewall Rule via cmd:
  
      netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Service Management" new enable=yes
  
    2. Grant Access to restart the server via cmd:
  
        sc sdset scmanager D:(A;;0x0015;;;S-1-5-21-1861021790-2432407240-1216284069-4890)(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)(A;;CC;;;AC)S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)
        "c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\subinacl.exe" /service OCRex.Web.ConvertDocument-* /grant=ocrex\Dev-Restart-Service-FileConversion=PTOSE
